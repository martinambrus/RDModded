RubyDung 2009 Modded
--------------------
This is a crazy experiment from some crazy people aiming at the creation of a ***[Bukkit-like modding API](https://github.com/martinambrus/RDApi)*** for one of the ***first versions of Minecraft*** from the year 2009 (back then still named *RubyDung*).

The aim of this project is to bring modularity to Minecraft from its earliest inception, and to be able to create something fun. And who knows - maybe even learn a thing or two about how Java games are created in the meanwhile :)

This repository will provide you with all the tools necessary to be ready for your dream RubyDung mod creation in just 2 steps.

All you need is an installation of [gradle](https://gradle.org/) (v2) (or better yet - [IntelliJ Idea IDE](https://gradle.org/)) and to run 2 commands. This will split up a RubyDung game which you can run via [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) and create plugins for.

You may want to check an example [Time Slower plugin](https://github.com/martinambrus/RDModded) to get you started. The API is fairly simple, event-driven and if you ever saw a [Bukkit API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/) or coded for [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/) / [Paper](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/) / [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) in your life, this should be all fairly familiar.

You may also want to check the [Minecraft Veteran Servers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMiKrpX4ViX4PGBOq1UXlvQ) for videos on creation of all this nonsense and perhaps some inspiration for creation of your own game / Minecraft clone :-D
